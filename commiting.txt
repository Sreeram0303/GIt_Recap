commiting 

always make sure to use the -m tag to write a commit message 

Logging 
we can use git log to get all the commmits happened so far but in long format, to have a quick peak we can use --oneline flag which makes the comamnd as 
git log --online

** Never be ashamed to have atomic commits, that makes the versioning simpler and understandable**
